# Real-time-crime-reporting-Application
  In any crime or emergency, how quickly we reach the crime or emergency spot plays an important role, also people won't get the actual information from the genuine source. Strangers in a new vicinity don't know the regions which are danger prone. Our App provides the solution to all the above problems. 
  
  This application was built as a project in hackathon DevHack 2.0 organized by IIT Dharwad. We team of 4 people have built 3 applications for 3 different users ( We had very less time, that’s why we haven’t merged all users in single app ) i.e. people, police station admin and patrolling vehicle police. I have built application for police admin which is able to receive crime reports from people through firebase, validate the reports, can see the real time locations of all patrolling vehicles using google map API and forward that report to nearest patrolling vehicle or police station. Also admin could be able to make reports public so that people can be aware of crimes or emergencies happening around them. Admin could be able to share posts of awareness too.
